# Report Card

Publish an online poll, except with letter grades instead of poll options.

# Getting Started
You'll need a server with Python and a database to record votes.

You'll also want to create a Google spreadsheet to allow people to create new report cards. NOTE: This could be done strictly on the database side instead.
